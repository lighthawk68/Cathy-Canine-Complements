	<p>Cathy Bickerstaff, RN-BC, is the Cathy of Cathy’s Canine Complements.  She has been a nurse for 37 years (she was VERY young when she started).  Cathy volunteers at the Humane Society of Memphis and Shelby County.  She mainly works with fearful dogs.  Cathy learned Pet Message at the PETMASSAGE™ Training and Research Institute in Toledo, OH.  She is a member of the International Association of Animal Massage and Bodywork and certified through the National Board of Certification for Animal Acupressure and Massage.  Cathy is certified in aromatherpay though the Pacific Institute of Aromatherapy.  Cathy welcomes the opportunity to work with you to enhance the well-being of your “fur baby”.</p>

	</blockquote>
	<p>Rusty was the first rescue from the Humane Society of Memphis and Shelby County back in 1998.  Rusty is an apricot miniature poodle.  He crossed over the rainbow bridge in 2013.  He was about 18 years old now.</p>

	</blockquote>
	<p>Mattie was originally named Madison after the street where she was found.  She was heart worm positive at the time the Humane Society took her in.  The treatment caused her thyroid to quit functioning so she was considered a special needs dog.  Mattie was Cathy’s first failure at foster.  Once Mattie was in Cathy’s home she never left.  Mattie fought a battle with skin cancer.  She crossed over the rainbow bridge January 2011.</p>

	</blockquote>
	<p>Dixie is another special needs dog.  She is believed to be a lab-Sharpei mix.  Dixie is not quite wired right.  The Human Society thought she or her mom had distemper and this damaged her nervous system.  Her gait is unique.  She swings her legs out and around as she walks.  Dixie is a happy girl even if she has difficulty negotiating steps and deals with skin allergies.</p>

	<blockquote>
	<img src="images/charlie.jpg" alt="Charlie" title="Charlie" style="margin: 5px; float: left;" />
	</blockquote>
	<p>Charlie appears to be a somber boy, but he gets a twinkle in his eye when he is thinking about doing something mischievous.  Cathy calls Charlie photo-shopped.  His head is Sharpei and his body is a type of bird dog.  He grew up in a neighborhood where the children were mean to him.  He was attacked by a pack of wild dogs and left for dead.  The first vet at the Humane Society to look at him thought it might be better to let him go, but the Humane Society thought he deserved another chance.  Cathy did counter conditioning with him to help him not mind getting a bath.  The bathtub became a safe place, which is a good thing because Charlie does not like loud noises – thunder, fireworks, etc.  During those stressful times Charlie takes refuge in the bathtub.</p>

	</blockquote>
	<p>Lisa is one of first fearful dogs Cathy worked with at the Humane Society of Memphis and Shelby County.  Not much is known of her history.  She also is fearful of thunder and will join Charlie in the bathtub.  Lisa appears to be a Golden Retriever and Chow mix.  She is a very sweet girl.</p>
